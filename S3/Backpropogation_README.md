# Backpropogation using Excel

## 1. Network Architecuture
The document captures the experience of creating a backpropogation using an excel sheet. The Neural network looks like the below.

The network is accepting 2 inputs, and has a hidden and an output layer. The sigmoid function has been used as an activation function.

## 2. Formulae for backprop
The following depicts the formulae that were used in order to calculate the total loss, the gradients, and the new weights.

## 3. Calculating Table
The below is a depiction of the table showing how the loss changed when learning rate went from 0.2 (table 1), and 1 (table 2).
Kindly note for brievity rows 6 to 95 have been hidden.
